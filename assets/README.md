# Project Static Assets

Unfortunately, working with visual assets is not in my wheelhouse. Included is
simple SVG depicting the Go Gopher with "password asterisks" overlayed on top.
The asterisks use the
[Cantarell](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cantarell/about) typeface.

This was generated just to have something to include as a favicon for the
project.
